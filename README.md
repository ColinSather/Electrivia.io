## Notes to self
3/31/2021
I've decided to do everything server side. I'm sure there are some benefits for client side rendering, in fact I like the idea of handling all the JSON logic all on the front end and having the backend simply do iOT stuff. However I think implementing a front end javascript framework such as React js would be overkill. 

The only reason I am using python in the first place is because it controlls GPIO pins VERY quickly, with very little lag.
