# Dysto Trivia
A trivia game that shocks players on wrong answers. Pretty dystopian right? [cringes]

## Notes to self
I am not sure what I want to do for the front end yet. Which is why all the flask routes simply return strings
containing html data. The "database" consists of a single json file, again not sure what to do about that either.
The only reason I am using this framework is because python works really well with the raspberry pi and iOT devices in general.
