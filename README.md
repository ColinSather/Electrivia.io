## MVP TODOs
* Find a better way to hold down tens unit button

## Future TODOs
* Improve over all system architecture
* Clone OpenTriviaDB (low)
* Use web sockets to enable each end user to view the same question (nice to have)
* Allow users to create their own quizzes
* Allow users to select a specific quiz categories and difficulties instead of starting a random quiz
* Package the hardware in a 3d printed box type thing
